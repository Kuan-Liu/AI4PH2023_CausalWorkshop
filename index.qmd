# Welcome

-   Welcome to the causal inference machine learning tutorial!
-   Workshop materials in the github repository [AI4PH2023_CausalWorkshop](https://github.com/Kuan-Liu/AI4PH2023_CausalWorkshop)

# Learning objectives

Causal inference methods, such as the propensity score analysis, have been established to permit causal inference from observational data. In recent years, a growing number of studies have explored the use of machine learning techniques in the causal modelling of complex health data subjected to high-dimensional confounding and complex causal structure. 

The **objective** of this tutorial is to introduce and demonstrate key machine learning methods used in causal inference for cross-sectional data with examples and ready-to-use code in the R programming language. 

By the end of this session, participants should be able to perform causal analysis in R using several machine learning approaches, such as gradient boosting, regression trees, and SuperLearner.
